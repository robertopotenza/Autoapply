# Railway Support Ticket: Critical Infrastructure Routing Issue

## **Project Information**
- **Project Name**: Autoapply
- **Service URL**: autoapply-production-1393.up.railway.app
- **Region**: us-west2
- **Service Type**: Node.js Express Application
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/robertopotenza/Autoapply

## **Issue Summary**
**CRITICAL**: Complete routing failure where Railway is not forwarding HTTP requests to our Express.js application, despite successful deployments and server startup confirmation in logs.

## **Detailed Problem Description**

### **Current Behavior**
- All HTTP requests to any endpoint return "Cannot GET [path]" errors
- This affects ALL routes: `/`, `/dashboard.html`, `/api/health`, `/test-deployment`, etc.
- The error appears to be at Railway's routing/proxy layer, not within our application

### **Expected Behavior**
- HTTP requests should be forwarded to our Express.js application running on port 8080
- Routes should return appropriate responses (HTML files, JSON API responses, etc.)

## **Technical Evidence**

### **✅ Deployment Logs Confirm Success**
```
2025-10-04T22:15:35.847Z INFO [Server] 🎯 Apply Autonomously server running on port 8080
2025-10-04T22:15:35.847Z INFO [Server] 📊 Dashboard: http://localhost:8080/dashboard
2025-10-04T22:15:35.848Z INFO [Server] 🧙‍♂️ Wizard: http://localhost:8080/wizard
2025-10-04T22:15:35.848Z INFO [Server] 🔌 API: http://localhost:8080/api
```

### **✅ Database Connection Working**
```
2025-10-04T22:15:35.832Z INFO [Server] ✅ Database connected successfully
```

### **✅ Port Configuration Correct**
```
2025-10-04T22:15:35.710Z INFO [Server] PORT (Railway): 8080
2025-10-04T22:15:35.710Z INFO [Server] PORT (Used): 8080
```

### **❌ All HTTP Requests Fail**
- `GET /` → "Cannot GET /"
- `GET /dashboard.html` → "Cannot GET /dashboard.html"
- `GET /api/health` → "Cannot GET /api/health"
- `GET /test-deployment` → "Cannot GET /test-deployment"

## **Troubleshooting Steps Attempted**

### **1. Multiple Cache-Busting Deployments**
- Deployed unique deployment identifiers to force fresh builds
- Confirmed latest code is active via deployment logs
- Issue persists across all deployments

### **2. Explicit Route Configuration**
- Added explicit Express routes for all HTML files
- Verified route order and middleware configuration
- Confirmed no route conflicts in application code

### **3. Port and Binding Verification**
- Confirmed application binds to `0.0.0.0:${PORT}`
- Verified PORT environment variable usage
- Logs show correct port binding (8080)

### **4. Local Testing Confirmation**
- Application works perfectly when run locally
- All routes respond correctly in local environment
- Confirms the issue is Railway-specific, not application code

## **Technical Configuration**

### **Express.js Server Configuration**
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', (error) => {
    if (error) {
        logger.error('❌ Failed to start server:', error);
        process.exit(1);
    }
    logger.info(`🎯 Apply Autonomously server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### **Route Examples**
```javascript
// Health endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ status: 'operational', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
});

// Explicit HTML file routes
app.get('/dashboard.html', (req, res) => {
    const dashboardPath = path.join(__dirname, '../public/dashboard.html');
    res.sendFile(dashboardPath);
});
```

### **Static File Serving**
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public')));
```

## **Environment Details**
- **Node.js Version**: 20.19.5 (from Railway logs)
- **Build System**: Nixpacks
- **Start Command**: `node src/server.js`
- **Environment**: Production
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (connected successfully)

## **Impact Assessment**
- **Severity**: Critical - Complete application unavailability
- **User Impact**: All users unable to access the application
- **Business Impact**: Production service completely non-functional
- **Duration**: Ongoing for multiple hours despite numerous deployment attempts

## **Suspected Root Cause**
Based on the evidence, this appears to be a **Railway infrastructure issue** where:
1. The application container starts successfully
2. The Express.js server binds correctly to port 8080
3. Railway's routing/proxy layer fails to forward HTTP requests to the container
4. All requests are terminated at Railway's edge with "Cannot GET" responses

## **Requested Support Actions**
1. **Investigate Railway's routing configuration** for this service
2. **Check proxy/load balancer settings** that forward requests to our container
3. **Verify network connectivity** between Railway's edge and our container
4. **Review any recent Railway infrastructure changes** that might affect routing
5. **Provide guidance** on Railway-specific configuration requirements we might be missing

## **Additional Information Available**
- Complete deployment logs and timestamps
- Application source code access via GitHub
- Local testing results demonstrating working functionality
- Detailed troubleshooting timeline and attempted solutions

## **Contact Information**
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/robertopotenza/Autoapply
- **Deployment ID**: CRITICAL-HTML-FIX-1759616135709
- **Service ID**: Available in Railway dashboard

**Note**: This issue is blocking critical business functionality. The application code is confirmed working locally, indicating this is specifically a Railway infrastructure/routing problem requiring platform-level investigation.
