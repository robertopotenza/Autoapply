# Wizard Edit Field Population Fix

## Problem
When users clicked the "Edit" button on the dashboard to modify their wizard configuration, fields in "Work Location & Job Preferences" and "Additional Screening Questions (Optional)" appeared blank, even though the data was successfully saved in the database.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Boolean Field Handling Issue
**Problem**: The `visa_sponsorship` field is stored as a BOOLEAN in the database, but the form uses pill buttons with 'yes'/'no' values. When the value was `false`, the condition `if (visaSponsorship)` would fail, preventing the "No" pill from being activated.

**Fix**: Changed the code to:
- Explicitly check for `null` and `undefined` instead of relying on truthiness
- Convert boolean values to 'yes'/'no' strings for pill selection
- Similar to how `is_adult` field was already correctly handled

### 2. Multi-Select Case Sensitivity Issue
**Problem**: The multi-select `setItems` method used strict `options.includes(item)` matching. If database values had:
- Different capitalization (e.g., "united states" vs "United States")
- Leading/trailing whitespace (e.g., " United States ")

They would not match the options array and wouldn't be displayed.

**Fix**: Enhanced the `setItems` method to:
- Trim whitespace from items before matching
- Try exact match first for performance
- Fall back to case-insensitive matching if exact match fails
- Log warnings when items can't be matched (for debugging)
- Log successful case-insensitive matches (for debugging)

## Files Modified

### `public/app.js`

#### Change 1: Fixed visa_sponsorship boolean handling (lines 1191-1205)
```javascript
// Before:
const visaSponsorship = userData.visa_sponsorship || userData.eligibility?.visa_sponsorship;
if (visaSponsorship) {
    const visaValue = visaSponsorship.toLowerCase();
    // ...
}

// After:
const visaSponsorship = userData.visa_sponsorship !== null && userData.visa_sponsorship !== undefined 
    ? userData.visa_sponsorship 
    : userData.eligibility?.visa_sponsorship;
if (visaSponsorship !== null && visaSponsorship !== undefined) {
    const visaValue = visaSponsorship ? 'yes' : 'no';
    // ...
}
```

#### Change 2: Enhanced multi-select setItems method (lines 355-375)
```javascript
// Before:
setItems: (items) => {
    selectedItems.clear();
    items.forEach(item => {
        if (options.includes(item)) {
            selectedItems.add(item);
        }
    });
    // ...
}

// After:
setItems: (items) => {
    selectedItems.clear();
    items.forEach(item => {
        const trimmedItem = typeof item === 'string' ? item.trim() : item;
        
        if (options.includes(trimmedItem)) {
            selectedItems.add(trimmedItem);
        } else {
            const matchedOption = options.find(opt => 
                opt.toLowerCase() === trimmedItem.toLowerCase()
            );
            if (matchedOption) {
                selectedItems.add(matchedOption);
                console.log(`üìù Matched "${trimmedItem}" to "${matchedOption}"`);
            } else {
                console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Could not match item "${trimmedItem}" in ${baseId} options`);
            }
        }
    });
    // ...
}
```

## Testing Plan

### Prerequisites
1. A user account with saved wizard data
2. Access to the dashboard with "Edit" button

### Test Cases

#### Test 1: Visa Sponsorship Boolean Field
**Steps:**
1. Fill out the wizard and select "No" for visa sponsorship
2. Submit the form
3. Go to dashboard and click "Edit"
4. Navigate to the Eligibility step
5. Verify the "No" pill is selected for visa sponsorship

**Expected Result:** The "No" pill should be visually selected (active state)

#### Test 2: Multi-Select Fields with Exact Matches
**Steps:**
1. Fill out the wizard and select countries like "United States", "Canada"
2. Submit the form
3. Go to dashboard and click "Edit"
4. Check Step 1 (remote countries), Step 3 (eligible countries, nationality), and screening (languages)

**Expected Result:** All selected items should appear as tags in the multi-select fields

#### Test 3: Multi-Select Fields with Case Variations
**Steps:**
1. Manually update database to have lowercase values (e.g., change "United States" to "united states")
2. Go to dashboard and click "Edit"
3. Check multi-select fields

**Expected Result:** 
- Items should still appear with correct capitalization from options
- Console should show matching logs like: `üìù Matched "united states" to "United States"`

#### Test 4: Multi-Select Fields with Whitespace
**Steps:**
1. Manually update database to have values with whitespace (e.g., " Canada ")
2. Go to dashboard and click "Edit"
3. Check multi-select fields

**Expected Result:** Items should appear correctly with whitespace trimmed

#### Test 5: All Fields in "Work Location & Job Preferences" Section
**Steps:**
1. Fill out all fields in Step 1 (Job Preferences) and Step 3 (Eligibility)
2. Submit the form
3. Go to dashboard and click "Edit"
4. Verify ALL fields are populated:
   - Step 1: Remote countries, onsite location, job types, job titles, seniority, timezones
   - Step 3: Current job title, availability, eligible countries, visa sponsorship, nationality, salaries

**Expected Result:** All fields should show previously saved values

#### Test 6: All Fields in "Additional Screening Questions" Section
**Steps:**
1. Expand and fill out all optional screening questions
2. Submit the form
3. Go to dashboard and click "Edit"
4. Verify the screening section is expanded and all fields are populated:
   - Experience summary, hybrid preference, travel, relocation, languages
   - Date of birth, GPA, age 18+, gender, disability, military, ethnicity, licenses

**Expected Result:** 
- Screening section should be automatically expanded
- All fields should show previously saved values

### Browser Console Checks
When editing, check the browser console for:
- ‚úÖ Success logs showing fields being populated
- üìù Matching logs for case-insensitive matches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning logs for any items that couldn't be matched
- ‚ùå No error logs related to field population

### Database Verification
After editing and re-saving, verify in the database that:
- JSONB arrays are properly formatted
- Boolean fields have correct true/false values
- Text fields have correct values
- No data loss occurred

## Additional Notes

### Fields Affected by These Fixes

#### Boolean Fields (affected by fix #1):
- `visa_sponsorship` in Eligibility section

#### Multi-Select Fields (affected by fix #2):
- `remote_jobs` in Job Preferences (Step 1)
- `time_zones` in Job Preferences (Step 1)
- `eligible_countries` in Eligibility (Step 3)
- `nationality` in Eligibility (Step 3)
- `languages` in Screening section

#### Pill Selection Fields (not directly affected but follow similar pattern):
- `job_types` in Job Preferences (Step 1)
- `seniority_levels` in Job Preferences (Step 1)
- `availability` in Eligibility (Step 3)
- `hybrid_preference` in Screening
- `travel` in Screening
- `relocation` in Screening
- `is_adult` in Screening (already correctly handled)

### Why `is_adult` Worked But `visa_sponsorship` Didn't
The `is_adult` field was already correctly handled with explicit null/undefined checks:
```javascript
if (userData.is_adult !== null && userData.is_adult !== undefined) {
    const isAdultValue = userData.is_adult ? 'yes' : 'no';
    // ...
}
```

But `visa_sponsorship` was using a truthy check:
```javascript
if (visaSponsorship) {  // This fails when visaSponsorship is false!
    // ...
}
```

## Validation
‚úÖ JavaScript syntax validated with `node -c public/app.js`
‚úÖ Server syntax validated with `node -c src/server.js`
‚úÖ Changes are minimal and surgical
‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality
‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and logging for debugging

## Deployment Notes
- These are frontend-only changes
- No database migrations required
- No backend API changes required
- Changes take effect immediately upon deployment
- Users may need to hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to clear cached JavaScript
