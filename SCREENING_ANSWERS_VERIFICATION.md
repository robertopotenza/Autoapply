# ScreeningAnswers Method Verification

## Summary
This document verifies that the `ScreeningAnswers` model in `src/routes/wizard.js` correctly uses the `upsert` method instead of a non-existent `save` method.

## Issue Description
The problem statement requested to find and replace any instances of:
```javascript
ScreeningAnswers.save(userId, data)
```

With:
```javascript
ScreeningAnswers.upsert(userId, data)
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ Code is Already Correct

**Finding:** No instances of `ScreeningAnswers.save()` were found in the codebase.

The code in `src/routes/wizard.js` is already using the correct method:

#### Line 195 (POST /api/wizard/screening endpoint):
```javascript
const result = await ScreeningAnswers.upsert(userId, data);
```

#### Line 234 (PUT /api/wizard/update endpoint - screening case):
```javascript
case 'screening':
    result = await ScreeningAnswers.upsert(userId, data);
    break;
```

### Model Definition Verification

The `ScreeningAnswers` model (`src/database/models/ScreeningAnswers.js`) defines only the following methods:
- ✅ `upsert(userId, data)` - Inserts or updates screening answers
- ✅ `findByUserId(userId)` - Retrieves screening answers
- ✅ `delete(userId)` - Deletes screening answers
- ❌ `save()` - **NOT DEFINED** (as expected)

## Testing

### New Test Suite Created
Created `tests/wizard-screening.test.js` with comprehensive tests:

1. **Endpoint Functionality Tests:**
   - ✅ POST /api/wizard/screening calls `ScreeningAnswers.upsert` with correct parameters
   - ✅ Handles empty/missing fields with appropriate defaults
   - ✅ Properly handles errors from `ScreeningAnswers.upsert`
   - ✅ PUT /api/wizard/update correctly routes to `ScreeningAnswers.upsert` for screening section

2. **Model Verification Tests:**
   - ✅ Verifies `ScreeningAnswers.upsert` exists and is a function
   - ✅ Verifies `ScreeningAnswers.save` does NOT exist
   - ✅ Confirms all expected methods are present

### Test Results
```
PASS  tests/wizard-screening.test.js
  Wizard Screening Endpoint
    POST /api/wizard/screening
      ✓ should call ScreeningAnswers.upsert with correct parameters
      ✓ should handle empty/missing fields with defaults
      ✓ should handle errors from ScreeningAnswers.upsert
    PUT /api/wizard/update - screening section
      ✓ should call ScreeningAnswers.upsert when updating screening section
    Verification: ScreeningAnswers only has upsert method
      ✓ should verify that ScreeningAnswers model does not have a save method
      ✓ should verify ScreeningAnswers has the correct methods

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       6 passed, 6 total

## Database Behavior

The `upsert` method implements the following SQL logic:
```sql
INSERT INTO screening_answers (...)
VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET
    experience_summary = EXCLUDED.experience_summary,
    hybrid_preference = EXCLUDED.hybrid_preference,
    ...
    updated_at = NOW()
RETURNING *
```

This ensures that:
1. If a record for the `user_id` doesn't exist, it's inserted
2. If a record already exists, it's updated
3. The `updated_at` timestamp is automatically set
4. The complete record is returned

## Conclusion

✅ **No changes needed** - The code is already correctly using `ScreeningAnswers.upsert(userId, data)`

✅ **Tests added** - Comprehensive test suite ensures this remains correct and prevents future regressions

✅ **Functionality verified** - The wizard submission will correctly insert/update rows in the `screening_answers` table

## Search Methodology

The following comprehensive search was performed:
```bash
# Search for any ScreeningAnswers.save calls
grep -rn "ScreeningAnswers\.save" src/

# Search for all files referencing ScreeningAnswers
find . -name "*.js" -type f ! -path "./node_modules/*" -exec grep -l "ScreeningAnswers" {} \;

# Results: No instances of .save() found
```

Files checked:
- `src/routes/wizard.js` ✅
- `src/database/models/ScreeningAnswers.js` ✅
- `src/ai/contentGenerator.js` ✅
- `src/models/AutoApplySettings.js` ✅
- `src/services/UserProfile.js` ✅

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Continue using `upsert`** - The current implementation is correct
2. ✅ **Run tests regularly** - The new test suite will catch any regressions
3. ✅ **Database ready** - Wizard submissions will properly save to `screening_answers` table
