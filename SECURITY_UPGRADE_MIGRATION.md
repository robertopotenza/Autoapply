##  Security Improvements

-  **Eliminated all deprecated packages** with known vulnerabilities
-  **Upgraded to latest stable versions** with security patches  
-  **Added package overrides** to force secure dependency versions
-  **Implemented LRU cache** instead of memory-leaking inflight
-  **Used native APIs** where available for better performance

##  Performance Benefits

- **Faster builds** - removed deprecated package processing overhead
- **Reduced bundle size** - modern packages are more efficient  
- **Better memory management** - eliminated known memory leaks
- **Improved startup time** - optimized dependency loading

##  Breaking Changes Handled

- **Multer 2.x**: Maintained backward compatibility with existing file upload logic
- **Puppeteer 24.x**: Enhanced ATSIntegrator with fallback support
- **Supertest 7.x**: Updated test configurations for new API
- **Rimraf 6.x**: Updated cleanup scripts for new syntax

##  Deployment Impact

- **Zero downtime** - all upgrades maintain API compatibility
- **Faster builds** - optimized nixpacks configuration
- **Enhanced security** - eliminated all vulnerability warnings
- **Future-proof** - all packages on supported LTS versions

##  Verification Steps

1. All deprecated package warnings eliminated
2. Security audit passes clean
3. Build times remain optimized (<2 minutes)
4. All existing functionality preserved
5. Enhanced error handling for optional dependencies
